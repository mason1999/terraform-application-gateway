## Example -- Simple ssl/tls termination

This example demonstrates the provisioning of the Application Gateway ssl / tls termination

To provision this example:

1. Ensure that `resource_group_name` is a valid resource group.
1. Ensure that `app_gateway_subnet_id` is the id of a valid subnet (reccomended size `/24` for ease).
1. Ensure that `key_vault_id` is valid.
1. Ensure that you have an SSL certificate in the keyvault.
